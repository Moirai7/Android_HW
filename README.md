There are many differnet branches we used to use.You can see the detail of our job.



Nowadays, with the growth of the world population,it's not rare to meet blind or deaf people when we walk around. They may meet a variety of problems because of the defect in their body.
For example:deaf people need sign language when communicating, however, most normal person haven't learned sign language,while blind can communicate only by speaking or braille, but most of the current devices does not support that. Because of all these problems, it is way more difficult for them to communicate.
So, in order to bring convenience to this special crowd and those normal person who have interest in the special crowd, we develop this APP. It works for:
 1)normal person who want to communicate with the special crowd;
 2)deaf people;
 3)blind.
 For the normal people who want to communicate with special populations,like volunteers,there are certain difficulties in communicating with special crowd.For blind or deaf people,they want to express themselves better in order to know more people.
 This APP aimed at providing them with such a platform,to help normal people know more about the world of blind and deaf people and give blind and deaf people a normal communication opportunity as well.
